Welcome to the documentation for `Pyrewall`_ - a small, open source Python 3 package
containing a variety of functions, classes, exceptions, decorators and more - each of which would otherwise
be too small to maintain in an individual package.

This documentation is automatically kept up to date by ReadTheDocs, as it is automatically re-built each time
a new commit is pushed to the `Github Project`_
